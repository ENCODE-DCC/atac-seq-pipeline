## Installation and tutorial

This pipeline supports many cloud platforms and cluster engines. It also supports `docker`, `singularity` and `Conda` to resolve complicated software dependencies for the pipeline. A tutorial-based instruction for each platform will be helpful to understand how to run pipelines. There are special instructions for two major Stanford HPC servers (SCG4 and Sherlock).
